# PlayStation5-Bot

Due to the scalpers reselling the new PlayStation above market price, I decided to make a tool to (hopefully) combat this. This Python bot constantly scrapes the Amazon Playstation5 page and when in stock, immediately adds one console to the cart and notifies the user of the action.

# Requirements

1. Google Chrome
2. [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
3. PiPy (installed with "pip install pypi-install")
4. All packages specified in the script (can easily be installed with pip, PiPy must be installed before this!)

# Instructions

1. Open main.py script and replace my chrome data with yours, the fields needed should be clearly described in the comments.
